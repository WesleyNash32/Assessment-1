// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, which entails you to analyze the situation and figure out what you need for the stakeholders."
const design = "The third step after analysis, in which this will be the prototyping stage and the design of what you'll be making."
const implementation = "Now the foruth step is when you start to implement the code into the software you are doing it."
const testingAndIntegration = "Then the second to last step is the testing stage of the code that you have implemented into the software and then integrate it into the software and test it until it works."
const maintain = "the final stage is to maintain meaning to always keep the code up to date making sure nothing is wrong and making sure there is not too many bugs."
